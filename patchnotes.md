## Notes
- No respackopts yet

## Testing focus
- Current tuning of all physics
- If any item that shouldnt be is rendered as block (doesnt have custom model and probably has weird positioning)
- Any bugs, obviously

Please ping @maingvaldsen  for any feedback about physics tunings, anything else probably belongs in #bugreports *without ping*
